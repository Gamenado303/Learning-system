# Introduction

A program to help students memorise information through different kinds of exercises. I hope to add QOL features to surpass the capabilities of other websites like Quizlet.

# Creating questions:

There will be different formats of questions for different types of questions:
- dates
- specific numbers
- definitions
- multiple points for an explanation
- spelling
- true or false
- ranking things in order (by date, size etc.)

# QOL features

Questions involving:
- dates or specific numbers will be tested more and will require more correct answers to fully master.
- definitions will have some leeway for synonyms.
- multiple points for an explanation will only require a few to be correct (unless otherwise specified)
- spelling will have text to speech features to enable students learn how to spell certain words
